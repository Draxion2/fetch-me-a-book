## Description

Fetch Me a Book is a GraphQL MERN stack application that challenged me to change it from traditional RestfulAPI routes. The functionality of searching, saving, and removing favorite books was already installed in the application.

## Purpose

The purpose of this application was to show my skills in how I can refactor a RestfulAPI route application into using GraphQL API using with an Apollo Server.

## Installation

This app is already deployed to Herkou but these steps will instruct on how it can be installed.

* Clone the git repository to your own machine.
* Run `npm i` or `npm install` in the command line to install all needed packages.
* Run `npm run develop` to run the React application as it should open in your default browser.
